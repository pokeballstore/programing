<!-- Lesson 01 - Hello World! -->
<!-- In this lesson we learn about input, output and variables -->
<!-- Save this file as hello.html and open it in your web browser -->

<!-- Start writing JavaScript code -->
<script>
// Create your variables at the top of the program
// Strings are text inside quotation marks ""
var hello = "Hello World!";

// Show the result on the screen with a dialog box
alert(hello);
</script>

// Notes and ELI5 for lesson 01 
// var = tells the computer “I’m making a new folder/binder on the shelf.”

// hello = the label or tab on the folder, so you can find it later.

// "Hello World!" = the notes/papers inside the folder. That’s the actual content stored.

// alert(hello) = you take the folder off the shelf, open it, and show what’s inside to the user in a pop-up window.

// So in code: 
// var hello = "Hello World!";
// alert(hello);
// First line: you make a folder called hello, and inside you put a paper that says Hello World!.

// Second line: you show the contents of that folder to whoever is looking at the screen.

// If you wrote this instead: When you put double quotation marks, you create a string (a string is just text for the computer, not something to execute).
// alert("Hello World!");
// You would skip the folder part and just show the paper directly.
// This is useful if you only need to show something once and don’t need to store it for later.
// Open Lesson 01 alert string to see the difference.
