//If you want to check if one input is smaller than another input then you can use the "less than operator" which is the "left angle bracket"::


var a = 1;
var b = 1;
var c = 2;

console.log(a != b); 
// The output is FALSE because the numbers are the same

console.log(a != c); 
// The output is TRUE because "a" and "c" are not the same
