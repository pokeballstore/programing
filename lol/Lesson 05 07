<!-- Start writing JavaScript code -->
<script>

// 1. "x" < "y"

console.log("x" < "y"); // true

//Both are strings, not numbers.
//JavaScript compares them alphabetically (like a dictionary).

// "x" comes before "y", so:

//2. "500" > "6"

// Here both are also strings (because they’re inside quotes).
// That means JavaScript compares them alphabetically character by character (not as numbers).

// "5" (the first character in "500") is compared to "6".

console.log("500" > "6"); // false


// Since "5" comes before "6" in the Unicode table, "500" is considered smaller than "6".

// If i remove the qoute so it is only integers me and the computer uses the same logic 
 console.log(500 > 6); // True
</script>
