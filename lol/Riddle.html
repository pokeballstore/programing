He studied everywhere, but the deeper he went, the more he realized he wasn‚Äôt satisfied. Years later, weary and discouraged, he returned home. Sitting again in the quiet of his own monastery, he suddenly saw with clarity: what he had sought in distant lands was always here. It wasn‚Äôt hidden in the world but in his own heart and practice.

Notes to self or intruder
==============================

When I have a prompt under the alert, the alert window will have an answer box under it so the user can type in the answer.

But I do not want that. I am having a chat with GPT to figure out how to make the prompt come after the alert is closed.

Hm, it seems that I broke your rules, Collin. Sorry about that.

My plan was to mock the user by saying they are wrong no matter what they type. But I got an idea to make a riddle / koan question instead.‚Äù
Did you know that a koan is a paradoxical anecdote or riddle, used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and to provoke enlightenment.

And your body is the temple of the soul. 

If you truly understand, you had the answer in you all along.
