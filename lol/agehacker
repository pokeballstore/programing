// ==============================
// 1) INTRODUCTION to age hacker
// ==============================
// This program asks for your name and age,
// then "hacks" your age into 21.
// Always 21, no matter what number you type in!
// If they type something that’s not a number, they will get a message
// telling them not to try to break the program. And that is mainly for Collin.... 

// ==============================
// 2) Start
// ==============================


// Start with an alert so the user knows what’s coming
alert("Welcome! To the Age Hacker");

// ==============================
// 3) INPUT in prompt boxes
// ==============================
// Ask the user for their name
var name = prompt("What is your name?");

// Ask the user for their current age
var ageInput = prompt("How old are you?");
var age = Number(ageInput); // Convert from string to number

// ==============================
// 4) PROCESS the input from prompt boxes
// ==============================
// Always turn their age into 21
var hackedAge = 21;

// Prepare output text
var message;

if (isNaN(age)) {
  message = "Don't try to break me. I'm fragile and I might do bad things from my basement!";
} else {
  message =
    "Hi " + (name || "friend") + "! You told me you are " + age + ". " +
    "But don't worry… I hacked your age into " + hackedAge + "! " +
    "Now I have hacked your age, " + (name || "friend") +
    ". You can do whatever you want and feel vital for the rest of your life!";
}

// ==============================
// 5) OUTPUT the result both in alert and document write
// ==============================
// Show result on the page
document.write(message);


// Test pop up alert and document write
// If input is NaN (not a number) → they get the basement message.
// We could also just convert everything to 21 no matter if it’s a string or number.
// But this way i have one more message to show you.

if (!isNaN(age)) {
  alert("Done! I hacked your age to " + hackedAge + ", " + (name || "friend") + ".");
}



// ==============================
// 6) Consol log
// ==============================


// We can check the name, age, and also what they wrote instead of a number
console.log("Raw input (before Number()):", ageInput);
console.log("Original age entered:", age);
console.log("Hacked age result:", hackedAge);

==============================
Notes
==============================

We combine alert and document.write to show output in two ways.

==============================
Notes for the future
==============================

It is messy with the comments, need to organize that better. but also good to be able to go back and see what i did, and thought.
You can check in the console what the user typed wrong. 
How do i check that as a developer? Becasuse now i am the user.....
