 Lesson  Notes 
==============================

var input = "This is the input data";

There is a variable called input.

Its value is a string (text).

var output = Boolean(input);

Here the computer takes that input value and pass it into the built-in function Boolean(...).

Boolean("This is the input data") checks:

Is this value truthy (something that exists, non-empty, non-zero)? → ✅ Yes.

Result = true.

That result (true) gets stored in a new variable called output.

document.write(output);

Finally, you documnet.write tells the browser: “Write the value of output onto the page.”

Since output holds the result of Boolean(input), the browser prints true.

It would have been false if it contained "" (empty string), 0, null, undefined, NaN, and false
