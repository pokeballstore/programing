//If you also want to check if the inputs are the same OR "greater than", then use an equals sign = directly AFTER the "greater than" > operator.

var a = 1;
var b = 1;
var c = 2;

console.log("Less Than Operator" , a > b); 
// The output is FALSE because 1 is equal to 1

console.log("Less Than Operator 'Is 2 bigger than 1'" , c > b); 
// The output is TRUE because 2 is bigger than 1

console.log("Less Than Operator 'Is 1 bigger then 2'" , b > c); 
// The output is FALSE because 1 is less than 2

console.log("Greater Than Or Equal To Operator" , a >= b); 
// The output is TRUE because 1 is equal to 1

console.log("Greater Than Or Equal To Operator" ,c >= b); 
// The output is TRUE because 2 is bigger than 1

console.log("Greater Than Or Equal To Operator" ,b >= c);
