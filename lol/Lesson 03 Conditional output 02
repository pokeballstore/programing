 Lesson 03 Notes
==============================
- Strings are case-sensitive: "Yes" ‚â† "yes".
- Normalize with answer.toLowerCase() (or toUpperCase()) before compare.
- This single check matches: "yes" "Yes" "yEs" ... "YES".

remember doubble == for if to work

you can essentially decide what ever you want with if and else statements. i will try to make a example with if and else staments that will mock the user and say the user is wrong no matter what they type.You find it in Lesson 03 conditional output 03.html
I changed the name to riddle and will send it to a friend that is full stack developer
