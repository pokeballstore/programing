// Step 1: Create variables at the top
var input;
var number;

// Step 2: INPUT - ask the user for a number (prompt always returns a STRING)
input = prompt("Enter a number:");

// Step 3: PROCESS - convert the STRING into a NUMBER
number = Number(input);

// Debug information (for the programmer, not the user)
// You can open the Console (F12 â†’ Console tab) to see this message
console.log("If the conversation works the number is: " + number); //before i put this in the console log i had it in the document.write but that is not good for the user. In the refined test I put this in the console.log

// Step 4: OUTPUT - show results to the user on the web page
document.write("You typed: " + input + "<br>"); // shows the raw string input
document.write("Doubble that number is: " + (number * 2)); // shows the calculation result

// lets see if i can find a new way to write the notes without putting them in the outside of the script and also to keep it clean.
// Ok, chat gpt wants me to put the notes in html comments on top of the script in <!DOCTYPE but i will put bigger keypoints under the script in html comments so it is not plain text on the page but still easy to read for me.
// The next Lesson i will make a template for the html and javascript so it is easier to start a new lesson without writing the same code over and over again.
